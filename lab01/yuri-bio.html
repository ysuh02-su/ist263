    1.	Hi everyone! My name is Yuri Suh, I'm from New Jersey, and I'm currently an undergraduate student at Syracuse University.
    <br>
    2.	I'm an Advertising major and a Psychology minor, interested in becoming an Art Director for an ad agency that focuses on non-profit marketing.
    <br>
    3.	Although I do not have much experience in the art field professionally, I do have a variety of accomplishments in the general advertising field. This past summer, I had the opportunity to intern at both Studio PAV and Joybees Footwear. At Studio PAV, I was in charge of social media marketing and graphic design. At Joybees, I was working with their marketing department to create a new campaign for their brand and execute creative ideas. Last year I was a research assistant under the Department of Psychology. I also have a passion for serving my community, so I joined the community service fraternity Alphi Phi Omega, as well as, started up (chartered) the first chapter of alpha Kappa Delta Phi International Sorority Inc. at Syracuse University. Currently, I'm an office assistant at the Health Promotions Office in the Barnes Center. As I learn more at the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications, I want to hone my skills in design and art in Adobe Creative Cloud. I'm also proficient in Microsoft Suite and Korean. 
    <br>
    4.	Outside of work, I love to sing, dance, play instruments (piano and flute), and draw in my sketchbook. I love being creative in the arts, but I'm also passionate about sports! I was in my high school basketball and track and field team, and I currently play volleyball. Some of my other hobbies include living and breathling Netflix every day. A talent of mine is binging shows on Netflix, and being able to finish most shows in 2 to 5 days.
    <br>
    5.	I'm so fortunate that I have so many things that excite me and that I had so many great opportunities in my life. I can't wait to experience more things and continue to challenge myself creatively and academically.
