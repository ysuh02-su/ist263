    <h1>Hall of Fame</h1>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Legends of the Decade in Broadway</h2>
   <br>
   <br>
   <h3 style="text-align: center; border: 3px solid black;">Nathan Lane</h3><br>
        <header><img src="../Projects/Images/Nathan-Lane-Photographed-by-Luke-Fontana3.jpg" class= "Bio pic" alt="Nathan Lane Bio pic"></header>
        To borrow a lyric from his Tony-winning character Max Bialystock, Nathan Lane reigns as “the king of old Broadway.” After his triumph in The Producers (2001), Lane could have coasted through his pick of musical revivals, but he's insisted on stretching his outsize talent in an impressive series of shows with nothing in common beyond his desire to bring them to Broadway: his own adaptation of The Frogs (2004), a smash-hit revival of The Odd Couple (2006), a black-comedy turn in Butley (2006), David Mamet’s satirical November (2008), an acclaimed revival of Waiting for Godot (2009) and now an irresistible performance as Gomez in the new musical The Addams Family. Wow! Where Nathan goes, audiences follow.

  <br>
  <h3 style="text-align: center;border: 3px solid black;">Patti LuPone</h3><br>
        <header><img src="../Projects/Images/Patti_LuPone.png" class= "Bio pic" alt="Patti LuPone Bio pic"></header>
        “Iconic” is one of those clichéd adjectives that gets slapped on all kinds of performances, but it’s tailor-made for the work of Patti LuPone. In the 30 years since she thrust her arms skyward in Evita Peron’s victory pose, LuPone has put her mark on plenty of larger-than-life dames. This distinctive actress disappeared from Broadway for much of the 1990s, then came roaring back in a pair of revivals perfectly suited to her brassy persona. After playing a proudly tarted-up, tuba-playing Mrs. Lovett in the 2005 revival of Sweeney Todd, she earned a Best Actress Tony Award in 2008 as Momma Rose in Gypsy—putting the fear of God in her stage kids and camera-wielding audience members at the same time.

  <br>
  <h3 style="text-align: center;border: 3px solid black;">Kristin Chenoweth</h3><br>
        <header><img src="../Projects/Images/Kristin_Chenoweth.jpg" class= "Bio pic" alt="Kristin Chenoweth Bio pic"></header>
        Broadway fans can count themselves lucky that Kristin Chenoweth turned down a Metropolitan Opera scholarship to pursue her passion for musical theater. After stealing the show (and winning a Tony) as Sally in You’re a Good Man, Charlie Brown, the Oklahoma-born soprano put her stamp on a role that dozens of actresses have played since—with her performance as their model—popular witch Glinda in the megahit Wicked. Though she’s achieved Hollywood success, including a sly turn as drunken nympho April on Glee, Chenoweth has continued to stretch herself onstage in The Apple Tree, Music in the Air (at Encores!) and now an utterly endearing star turn in Promises, Promises. Here’s hoping she’s back in New York to stay.

  <br>
  <h3 style="text-align: center;border: 3px solid black;">Harvey Fierstein</h3><br>
        <header><img src="../Projects/Images/Harvey_Fierstein.jpg" class= "Bio pic" alt="Harvey Fierstein Bio pic"></header>
        A true man of the theater, Harvey Fierstein makes everything he does look easy, an impressive feat when you consider that his four Tony Awards include Best Play and Best Actor in a Play (Torch Song Trilogy), Best Actor in a Musical (Hairspray) and Best Book of a Musical (La Cage aux Folles). Fierstein has kept up his prolific pace for almost 30 years, most recently as book writer and star of A Catered Affair and on tour as Teyve in Fiddler on the Roof. (Heck, he even missed opening night of Broadway's acclaimed La Cage revival because he was working in D.C.!) In addition to his gifts as a writer and actor, Fierstein has mentored countless young stage artists—he’s a superstar and a mensch.

   <h3 style="text-align: center;border: 3px solid black;">Hugh Jackman</h3><br>
        <header><img src="../Projects/Images/Hugh_Jackman.jpg" class= "Bio pic" alt="Hugh Jackman Bio pic"></header>
        Just call him Broadway’s ambassador to the world. Hugh Jackman got his start onstage in his native Australia, conquered London in Oklahoma!, then proved his star power in The Boy from Oz, never missing a Broadway performance in the exhausting role of song-and-dance man Peter Allen. Inevitably, this sexy Tony winner became a big movie star, but Jackman continued his one-man campaign to keep theater on the cultural front-burner, hosting the Tonys and inserting Broadway-style razzmatazz as host of the Oscars. Producers would gladly mount any show starring Jackman, but the actor surprised everyone last fall by choosing to play a violent Chicago cop in an unknown play, A Steady Rain, raking in $1 million a week alongside Daniel Craig. Plus, in real life, he’s a sweetheart!
